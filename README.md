# followers-vs-following
 Compare your Github followers vs following users

 https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/users
 
 The code only queries 3k followers & 3k following based on the API limits
 
 This will return two lists;
 - Users following you but have not followed them
 - Users you have followed but are not following you
